### 1. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)

**Purpose**  
To observe the cross-sectional morphology of the Pd/Ni(P) interface, examine how roughness evolves with different **thicknesses**, and detect possible **contamination or defects** at the interface.

**Principle**  
SEM uses a focused electron beam to scan the sample surface. The interaction generates secondary and backscattered electrons, which are used to construct images showing surface topography and material contrast.

**Parameters**
- Accelerating voltage: 5–15 kV  
- Working distance: 5–10 mm  
- Detectors: SE (surface detail), BSE (material contrast)

**Usage in this study**
- Compare edge roughness of Pd layers in thin and thick samples  
- Identify growth modes (e.g., columnar, nodular, uniform)  
- Detect voids or detachment at the Pd/Ni(P) interface

### 2. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)

**Purpose**  
To **quantify** the surface roughness of Pd films using **Ra, Rq, and **Rz values** with nanometer-level resolution.

**Principle**  
AFM employs a cantilever with a sharp tip that scans over the surface. The tip deflection due to surface interaction is recorded and converted into a topographic height map.

**Parameters**
- Scan size: 5 µm × 5 µm or 10 µm × 10 µm  
- Resolution: ≥512 × 512 pixels  
- Operating mode: Tapping mode

**Usage in this study**
- Measure Ra, Rq, and Rz for Pd surfaces with different thicknesses  
- Compare roughness metrics with SEM image observations  
- Isolate Pd roughness behavior from substrate effects

### 3. X-ray Diffraction (XRD)

**Purpose**  
To study crystallinity, **internal stress**, and **potential phase changes** in the Pd layer.

**Principle**  
X-rays diffract from atomic planes according to Bragg’s law. The position, intensity, and width of diffraction peaks provide information about crystal structure, lattice spacing, and grain size.

**Parameters**
- 2θ scan range: 30°–90°  
- Step size: ≤0.02°  
- Scan geometry: θ–2θ or grazing incidence (GIXRD)

**Usage in this study**
- Detect residual stress buildup during Pd thickening  
- Observe peak broadening or shifts as evidence of strain or recrystallization  
- Confirm absence of undesired phases such as Pd₃P or PdHₓ

### 4. Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD)

**Purpose**  
To analyze grain size, **grain orientation**, and crystallographic texture in the Pd layer.

**Principle**  
EBSD uses backscattered electrons to produce Kikuchi patterns from crystalline structures. These patterns are indexed to reveal local crystal orientations.

**Parameters**
- Accelerating voltage: 15–20 kV  
- Sample tilt: 70°  
- Step size: 50–100 nm  
- Sample preparation: FIB-polished cross-section

**Usage in this study**
- Determine whether grain size increases with Pd thickness  
- Identify development of preferred orientation (texture)  
- Support interpretation of roughness evolution through grain behavior
